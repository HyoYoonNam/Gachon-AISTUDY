In the literature on asymmetric autoencoders, both encoder-focused and decoder-focused architectures have been explored, each with unique advantages depending on the data characteristics and task requirements.

1. **Encoder-Dominant Architectures**:  
   These designs typically have a larger number of nodes in the encoder layers than in the decoder layers. This configuration is often used for applications that prioritize feature extraction, such as anomaly detection or representation learning. By compressing data early, encoder-dominant models capture more abstract features, which can benefit tasks where a compact and expressive representation is critical.  
   - Encoder Nodes > Decoder Nodes
   - Encoder가 더 중요할 때. feature extraction. anormaly detection. ....
   

2. **Decoder-Dominant Architectures**:  
   When the decoder has more nodes, the model is usually focused on reconstructing complex details. This approach is beneficial in cases such as generative tasks (e.g., image generation) where reconstructing high-dimensional outputs with fine details is important. Decoder-dominant autoencoders often generalize well for tasks requiring detailed data reconstructions from a small, compressed bottleneck.  
   - Encoder Nodes < Decoder Nodes
   - Decoder가 더 중요할 때. 주어진 latent로부터 더 다양한(?) 결과를 generative.

In general, which structure is more advantageous depends on the intended purpose. A well-known reference for autoencoder architecture designs is the paper “Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes” by Kingma and Welling (2014), which discusses asymmetric designs in the context of variational autoencoders. For more traditional autoencoders, similar discussions are found in studies on denoising autoencoders and sparse autoencoders where the encoder-focused approach often prevails.
